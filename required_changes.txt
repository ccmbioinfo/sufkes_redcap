# This is a list of all of the changes I need to make to my scripts before I finish:

Scripts that need to read lists of specific API tokens and URLs.

Scripts that require specific logging files:
/misc/parseLogging.py

Scripts that require an output folder:


Scripts that require event_id numbers:
/misc/getEventIDs.py

Things I need to set up to work with IPSS V4:
/misc/getEventIDs.py
/misc/parseLogging.py
/reports/makeDataPackage.py

Other:
- Change the way that all scripts read API keys. I should set it up so that a user will have a single file with the format:
<project id> <api url> <api key>
and they can simply specify the project_id as an argument to the script.
- getEventIDs.py should read from a JSON file. 
- Set it up so that there is a single supplementary (nonpublic) folder containing:
    - API URL/token & project ID files.
    - Logging for IPSS V1, V2, V3, V4.
    - Output for:
        - qc
	- makeDataPackage.py
