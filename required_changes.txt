Scripts that need to work properly with and without settings.yml and api_keys.yml:
transferPSOMToIPSS.py

Scripts that require specific logging files:
/misc/parseLogging.py

Scripts that require event_id numbers:
/misc/getEventIDs.py

Things I need to set up to work with IPSS V4:
/misc/getEventIDs.py
/misc/parseLogging.py
/reports/makeDataPackage.py
